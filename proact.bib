abstract = {Objective: To prospectively study changes in the social networks of persons at presumably high risk for HIV in a community with low prevalence and little endogenous transmission.

Methods: From a cohort of 595 persons at high risk (prostitutes, injecting drug users, and sexual partners of these persons) and nearly 6000 identified contacts, we examined the social networks of a subset of 96 persons who were interviewed once per year for 3 years. We assessed their network configuration, network stability, and changes in risk configuration and risk behavior using epidemiologic and social network analysis, and visualization techniques.

Results: Some significant decrease in personal risk-taking was documented during the course of the study, particularly with regard to needle-sharing. The size and number of connected components (groups that are completely connected) declined. Microstructures (small subgroups of persons that interact intensely) were either not present, or declined appreciably during the period of observation. 
Conclusions: In this area of low prevalence, the lack of endogenous transmission of HIV may be related in part to the lack of a network structure that fosters active propagation, despite the continued presence of risky behaviors. Although the relative contribution of network structure and personal behavior cannot be ascertained from these data, the study suggests an important role for network configuration in the transmission dynamics of HIV.},

abstract = {Background
Phylogenetics has been used to investigate HIV transmission among men who have sex with men. This study compares several methodologies to elucidate the role of transmission chains in the dynamics of HIV spread in Quebec, Canada.

Methods
The Quebec Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) genotyping program database now includes viral sequences from close to 4,000 HIV-positive individuals classified as Men who have Sex with Men (MSMs), collected between 1996 and early 2016. Assessment of chain expansion may depend on the partitioning scheme used, and so, we produce estimates from several methods: the conventional Bayesian and maximum likelihood-bootstrap methods, in combination with a variety of schemes for applying a maximum distance criterion, and two other algorithms, DM-PhyClus, a Bayesian algorithm that produces a measure of uncertainty for proposed partitions, and the Gap Procedure, a fast non-phylogenetic approach. Sequences obtained from individuals in the Primary HIV Infection (PHI) stage serve to identify incident cases. We focus on the period ranging from January 1st 2012 to February 1st 2016.

Results and conclusion
The analyses reveal considerable overlap between chain estimates obtained from conventional methods, thus leading to similar estimates of recent temporal expansion. The Gap Procedure and DM-PhyClus suggest however moderately different chains. Nevertheless, all estimates stress that longer older chains are responsible for a sizeable proportion of the sampled incident cases among MSMs. Curbing the HIV epidemic will require strategies aimed specifically at preventing such growth.},

abstract = {Background: Detecting recent and rapid spread of HIV can help prioritize prevention and early treatment for those at highest risk of transmission. HIV genetic sequence data can identify transmission clusters, but previous approaches have not distinguished clusters of recent, rapid transmission. We assessed an analytic approach to identify such clusters in the United States. Methods: We analyzed 156,553 partial HIV-1 polymerase sequences reported to the National HIV Surveillance System and inferred transmission clusters using 2 genetic distance thresholds (0.5{\%} and 1.5{\%}) and 2 periods for diagnoses (all years and 2013-2015, ie, recent diagnoses). For rapidly growing clusters (with {\$}5 diagnoses during 2015), molecular clock phylogenetic analysis estimated the time to most recent common ancestor for all divergence events within the cluster. Cluster transmission rates were estimated using these phylogenies. Results: A distance threshold of 1.5{\%} identified 103 rapidly growing clusters using all diagnoses and 73 using recent diagnoses; at 0.5{\%}, 15 clusters were identified using all diagnoses and 13 using recent diagnoses. Molecular clock analysis estimated that the 13 clusters identified at 0.5{\%} using recent diagnoses had been diversifying for a median of 4.7 years, compared with 6.5-13.2 years using other approaches. The 13 clusters at 0.5{\%} had a transmission rate of 33/100 person-years, compared with previous national estimates of 4/100 person-years. Conclusions: Our approach identified clusters with transmission rates 8 times those of previous national estimates. This method can identify groups involved in rapid transmission and help programs effectively direct and prioritize limited public health resources.},

abstract = {Although fishing communities (FCs) in Uganda are disproportionately affected by HIV-1 relative to the general population (GP), the transmission dynamics are not completely understood. We earlier found most HIV-1 transmissions to occur within FCs of Lake Victoria. Here, we test the hypothesis that HIV-1 transmission in FCs is isolated from networks in the GP. We used phylogeography to reconstruct the geospatial viral migration patterns in 8 FCs and 2 GP cohorts and a Bayesian phylogenetic inference in BEAST v1.8.4 to analyse the temporal dynamics of HIV-1 transmission. Subtype A1 (pol region) was most prevalent in the FCs (115, 45.1{\%}) and GP (177, 50.4{\%}). More recent HIV transmission pairs from FCs were found at a genetic distance (GD) {\textless}1.5{\%} than in the GP (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.001). The mean time depth for pairs was shorter in FCs (5 months) than in the GP (4 years). Phylogeographic analysis showed strong support for viral migration from the GP to FCs without evidence of substantial viral dissemination to the GP. This suggests that FCs are a sink for, not a source of, virus strains from the GP. Targeted interventions in FCs should be extended to include the neighbouring GP for effective epidemic control.},

abstract = {Background: Transgender women are among the groups at highest risk for HIV infection, with a prevalence of 27{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} in the USA; and despite this known high risk, undiagnosed infection is common in this population. We set out to identify transgender women and their partners in a molecular transmission network to prioritise public health activities. Methods: Since 2006, HIV protease and reverse transcriptase gene (pol) sequences from drug resistance testing have been reported to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and linked to demographic data, gender, and HIV transmission risk factor data for each case in the enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System. We reconstructed a molecular transmission network by use of HIV-TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (with a pairwise genetic distance threshold of 0{\textperiodcentered}015 substitutions per site) from the earliest pol sequences from 22 398 unique individuals, including 412 (2{\%}) self-identified transgender women. We examined the possible predictors of clustering with multivariate logistic regression. We characterised the genetically linked partners of transgender women and calculated assortativity (the tendency for people to link to other people with the same attributes) for each transmission risk group. Findings: 8133 (36{\textperiodcentered}3{\%}) of 22 398 individuals clustered in the network across 1722 molecular transmission clusters. Transgender women who indicated a sexual risk factor clustered at the highest frequency in the network, with 147 (43{\%}) of 345 being linked to at least one other person (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2{\textperiodcentered}0, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0002). Transgender women were assortative in the network (assortativity 0{\textperiodcentered}06, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}001), indicating that they tended to link to other transgender women. Transgender women were more likely than expected to link to other transgender women (OR 4{\textperiodcentered}65, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}001) and cisgender men who did not identify as men who have sex with men (MSM; OR 1{\textperiodcentered}53, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}001). Transgender women were less likely than expected to link to MSM (OR 0{\textperiodcentered}75, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}001), despite the high prevalence of HIV among MSM. Transgender women were distributed across 126 clusters, and cisgender individuals linked to one transgender woman were 9{\textperiodcentered}2 times more likely to link to a second transgender woman than other individuals in the surveillance database. Reconstruction of the transmission network is limited by sample availability, but sequences were available for more than 40{\%} of diagnoses. Interpretation: Clustering of transgender women and the observed tendency for linkage with cisgender men who did not identify as MSM, shows the potential to use molecular epidemiology both to identify clusters that are likely to include undiagnosed transgender women with HIV and to improve the targeting of public health prevention and treatment services to transgender women.

abstract = {Background: Current public health efforts often use molecular technologies to identify and contain communicable disease networks, but not for HIV. Here, we investigate how molecular epidemiology can be used to identify highly related HIV networks within a population and how voluntary contact tracing of sexual partners can be used to selectively target these networks. Methods: We evaluated the use of HIV-1 pol sequences obtained from participants of a community-recruited cohort (n = 268) and a primary infection research cohort (n = 369) to define highly related transmission clusters and the use of contact tracing to link other individuals (n = 36) within these clusters. The presence of transmitted drug resistance was interpreted from the pol sequences (Calibrated Population Resistance v3.0). Results: Phylogenetic clustering was conservatively defined when the genetic distance between any two pol sequences was less than 1{\%}, which identified 34 distinct transmission clusters within the combined community-recruited and primary infection research cohorts containing 160 individuals. Although sequences from the epidemiologicaIIy linked partners represented approximately 5{\%} of the total sequences, they clustered with 60{\%} of the sequences that clustered from the combined cohorts (odds ratio 21.7; P≤ 0.01). Major resistance to at least one class of antiretroviral medication was found in 19{\%} of clustering sequences. Conclusion: Phylogenetic methods can be used to identify individuals who are within highly related transmission groups, and contact tracing of epidemiologically linked partners of recently infected individuals can be used to link into previously defined transmission groups. These methods could be used to implement selectively targeted prevention interventions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Ukraine has one of the largest HIV epidemics in Europe, historically driven by people who inject drugs (PWID). The epidemic showed signs of stabilization in 2012, but the recent war in eastern Ukraine may be reigniting virus spread. We investigated the movement of HIV-infected people within Ukraine before and during the conflict. We analyzed HIV-1 subtype-A pol nucleotide sequences sampled during 2012–2015 from 427 patients of 24 regional AIDS centers and used phylogeographic analysis to reconstruct virus movement among different locations in Ukraine. We then tested for correlations between reported PWID behaviors and reconstructed patterns of virus spread. Our analyses suggest that Donetsk and Lugansk, two cities not controlled by the Ukrainian government in eastern Ukraine, were significant exporters of the virus to the rest of the country. Additional analyses showed that viral dissemination within the country changed after 2013. Spearman correlation analysis showed that incoming virus flow was correlated with the number of HIV-infected internally displaced people. Additionally, there was a correlation between more intensive virus movement and locations with a higher proportion of PWID practicing risky sexual behaviors. Our findings suggest that effective prevention responses should involve internally displaced people and people who frequently travel to war-affected regions. Scale-up of harm reduction services for PWID will be an important factor in preventing new local HIV outbreaks in Ukraine.},

Results showed that the scales were reliable and correlated with convergent and divergent measures in expected directions in samples of both gay men (N = 296) and inner city low-income men and women (N = 158). Consistent with theories of sensation seeking, the scales corresponded to an attraction toward a range of sexual practices, including increased frequencies of unprotected intercourse and a greater number of sexual partners. As expected, sexual compulsivity was not related to variety and novelty in sexual practices, but was associated with lower levels of self-esteem and resistance to adopting sexual risk-reducing strategies. However important differences were observed between the gay men and heterosexual samples; scales correlated with substance use only among gay men, and sexual compulsivity was related to a range of sexual practices only among heterosexuals. The sensation seeking and Sexual Compulsivity Scales were therefore reliable, appeared valid, and useful in predicting sexual risk behaviors.},

Because our focus is on psychosocial predictors of level of unprotected sex after completion of AOD/ HIV-TRR treatment, we first controlled for potential confounds including (a) intake level of unprotected sex and (b) both intake and follow-up AOD abuse values. Further, because associations between both stress and social support and level of risk behavior may be attributable to underlying pathological personality factors, we controlled for these factors in analyses of stress and support effects. Sequential regression was employed to determine if personality and then stress and social support characteristics improved prediction of unprotected sex after entering covariates. Pretreatment levels of unprotected sex and dependent personality significantly predicted unprotected sex during follow-up. Avoidant personality was associated with reduced risk linked with lower levels of sexual involvement. Perceived stress and social support did not significantly predict level of unprotected sex during follow-up.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an easy-to-use prediction model for HIV acquisition among men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: We developed prediction models using medical records data from an STD clinic (2001-2008) and validated these models using data from the control arm of Project Explore, an HIV prevention trial (1999-2003). RESULTS: Of 1903 MSM who tested for HIV more than once in the development sample, 101 acquired HIV over 6.7 years of follow-up. Annual HIV incidence was 2.57{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 2.09{\%}, 3.12{\%}). During 4 years of follow-up of 2081 Project Explore control arm participants, 144 acquired HIV for an incidence of 2.32{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.96{\%}, 2.73{\%}). A prediction model that included variables indicating use of methamphetamine or inhaled nitrites in the prior 6 months, unprotected anal intercourse with a partner of positive or unknown HIV status in the prior year, ≥10 male sex partners in the prior year, and current diagnosis or history of bacterial sexually transmitted infection was well calibrated overall (expected-observed ratio = 1.01; 95{\%} CI: 0.97, 1.05) and had modest discriminatory accuracy at 1 year (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve = 0.67; 95{\%} CI: 0.60, 0.75) and at 4 years (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve = 0.66; 95{\%} CI: 0.61, 0.71). Over 4 years, cumulative incidence ranged from 3.9{\%} to 14.3{\%} for groups of men defined by the prediction model.

abstract = {Clustering homologous sequences based on their similarity is a problem that appears in many bioinformatics applications. The fact that sequences cluster is ultimately the result of their phylogenetic relationships. Despite this observation and the natural ways in which a tree can define clusters, most applications of sequence clustering do not use a phylogenetic tree and instead operate on pairwise sequence distances. Due to advances in large-scale phylogenetic inference, we argue that tree-based clustering is under-utilized. We define a family of optimization problems that, given a (not necessarily ultrametric) tree, return the minimum number of clusters such that all clusters adhere to constraints on their heterogeneity. We study three specific constraints that limit the diameter of each cluster, the sum of its branch lengths, or chains of pairwise distances. These three versions of the problem can be solved in time that increases linearly with the size of the tree, a fact that has been known by computer scientists for two of these three criteria for decades. We implement these algorithms in a tool called TreeCluster, which we test on three applications: OTU picking for microbiome data, HIV transmission clustering, and divide-and-conquer multiple sequence alignment. We show that, by using tree-based distances, TreeCluster generates more internally consistent clusters than alternatives and improves the effectiveness of downstream applications.

In the first type the individuals have a given order A which is objectively defined with reference to some quality, and a characteristic question is: if an observer ranks the individuals in an order B, does a comparison of B with A suggest that he possesses a reliable judgment of the quality, or, alternatively, is it probable that B could have arisen by chance? In the second type no objective order is given. Two observers consider the individuals and rank them in orders A and B. The question now is, are these orders sufficiently alike to indicate similarity of taste in the observers, or, on the other hand, are A and B incompatible within assigned limits of probability 1 An example of the first type occurs in the familiar experiments wherein an observer has to arrange a known set of weights in ascending order of weight; the second type would arise if two observers had to rank a set of musical compositions in order of preference.},

abstract = {Data streams whose events occur at random arrival times rather than at the regular, tick-tock intervals of traditional time series are increasingly prevalent. Event series are continuous, irregular and often highly sparse, differing greatly in nature to the regularly sampled time series traditionally the concern of hard sciences. As mass sets of such data have become more common, so interest in predicting future events in them has grown. Yet repurposing of traditional forecasting approaches has proven ineffective, in part due to issues such as sparsity, but often due to inapplicable underpinning assumptions such as stationarity and ergodicity. In this paper we derive a principled new approach to forecasting event series that avoids such assumptions, based upon: 1. The processing of event series datasets in order to produce a first parameterized mixture model of non-homogeneous Poisson processes, and 2. Application of a technique called parallel forecasting that uses these processes' rate functions to directly generate accurate temporal predictions for new query realizations. This approach uses forerunners of a stochastic process to shed light on the distribution of future events, not for themselves, but for realizations that subsequently follow in their footsteps.},

abstract = {Large phylogenomics data sets require fast tree inference methods, especially for maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies. Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2{\%} and 87.1{\%} of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7{\%} and 47.1{\%} of the DNA alignments and 42.2{\%} and 100{\%} of the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods with IQ-TREE improves to 73.3-97.1{\%}. IQ-TREE is freely available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree.},

abstract = {Background: The impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on sexual risk behavior and HIV transmission among HIV-infected persons in Africa is unknown. Objective: To assess changes in risky sexual behavior and estimated HIV transmission from HIV-infected adults after 6 months of ART. Design and methods: A prospective cohort study was performed in rural Uganda. Between May 2003 and December 2004 a total of 926 HIV-infected adults were enrolled and followed in a home-based ART program that included prevention counselling, voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for cohabitating partners and condom provision. At baseline and follow-up, participants' HIV plasma viral load and partner-specific sexual behaviors were assessed. Risky sex was defined as inconsistent or no condom use with partners of HIV-negative or unknown serostatus in the previous 3 months. The rates of risky sex were compared using a Poisson regression model and transmission risk per partner was estimated, based on established viral load-specific transmission rates. Results: Six months after initiating ART, risky sexual behavior reduced by 70{\%} [adjusted risk ratio, 0.3; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.2-0.7; P ¼ 0.0017]. Over 85{\%} of risky sexual acts occurred within married couples. At baseline, median viral load among those reporting risky sex was 122 500 copies/ml, and at follow-up, {\textless} 50 copies/ml. Estimated risk of HIV transmission from cohort members declined by 98{\%}, from 45.7 to 0.9 per 1000 person years. Conclusions: Providing ART, prevention counseling, and partner VCT was associated with reduced sexual risk behavior and estimated risk of HIV transmission among HIV-infected Ugandan adults during the first 6 months of therapy. Integrated ART and prevention programs may reduce HIV transmission in Africa.},

@article{Spinner2016,
abstract = {Purpose
Despite established HIV prevention strategies and broadly available diagnostic strategies in developed western countries, rates of HIV new infections remain high. Alternative strategies for HIV prevention, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM), are crucial. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been discussed as one additional option that this review seeks to explore.

Methods
An online search identifying PrEP-relevant literature from 1st January 2010 to 1st August, 2015 was performed.

Results
The iPrEx study, first published in 2010, demonstrated a reduction in relative risk (RRR) of HIV seroconversion of 44 {\%} for continuous PrEP with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) in MSM. The efficacy of PrEP has been confirmed for continuous PrEP in the PROUD study and for intermittent PrEP in the IPERGAY study (RRR = 86 {\%} in both studies). The PrEP was well tolerated in all studies, and the evolution of HIV resistance has been low. Compensatory increased sexual risk behavior was not observed in recent studies. In contrast to the high efficacy of risk reduction for HIV transmission in MSM, the results of TDF PrEP and TDF/FTC PrEP studies using microbicidal agents or pills among heterosexual women were different (RRR 6–75 {\%}).

Conclusions
Continuous and intermittent PrEP demonstrated high efficacy in preventing HIV seroconversion, notably among MSM. PrEP was well tolerated. Adherence was critical for high efficacy in all studies. Further studies to evaluate implementation strategies and cost-effectiveness in different risk populations are needed as well as drug approval in Europe.},

abstract = {Background: HIV evolves rapidly and therefore infections with similar genetic sequences are likely linked by recent transmission events. Clusters of related infections can represent subpopulations with high rates of transmission. We describe the implementation of an automated near real-time system to monitor and characterise HIV transmission hotspots in British Columbia, Canada. Methods: In this implementation case study, we applied a monitoring system to the British Columbia drug treatment database, which holds more than 32 000 anonymised HIV genotypes for nearly 9000 residents of British Columbia living with HIV. On average, five to six new HIV genotypes are deposited in the database every day, which triggers an automated reanalysis of the entire database. We extracted clusters of five or more individuals with short phylogenetic distances between their respective HIV sequences. The system generated monthly reports of the growth and characteristics of clusters that were distributed to public health officers. Findings: In June, 2014, the monitoring system detected the expansion of a cluster by 11 new cases during 3 months, including eight cases with transmitted drug resistance. This cluster generally comprised young men who have sex with men. The subsequent report precipitated an enhanced public health follow-up to ensure linkage to care and treatment initiation in the affected subpopulation. Of the nine cases associated with this follow-up, all had already been linked to care and five cases had started treatment. Subsequent to the follow-up, three additional cases started treatment and most cases achieved suppressed viral loads. During the next 12 months, we detected 12 new cases in this cluster with reduction in the onward transmission of drug resistance. Interpretation: Our findings show the first application of an automated phylogenetic system monitoring a clinical database to detect a recent HIV outbreak and support the ensuing public health response. By making secondary use of routinely collected HIV genotypes, this approach is cost-effective, attains near real-time monitoring of new cases, and can be implemented in all settings in which HIV genotyping is the standard of care.

Objective: The objective of this study was to test statistically whether distributions of numbers of sexual partners reported from different populations are well described by power laws.

Study Design: Power laws and an exponential null model are fitted by maximum likelihood techniques to reported distributions of numbers of partners. Data are taken from 4 population-based surveys, 3 from Britain and 1 from rural Zimbabwe.

Results: The networks can be described by power laws over a number of orders of magnitude. In addition, the derived exponents differ significantly and meaningfully, with an “accelerating network” formed between men who have sex with men (MSM).

Conclusions: A scale-free network approach provides a reasonable description of distributions of reported numbers of sexual partners.},

abstract = {In modern applications of molecular epidemiology, genetic sequence data are routinely used to identify clusters of transmission in rapidly evolving pathogens, most notably HIV-1. Traditional 'shoe-leather' epidemiology infers transmission clusters by tracing chains of partners sharing epidemiological connections (e.g., sexual contact). Here, we present a computational tool for identifying a molecular transmission analog of such clusters: HIV-TRACE (TRAnsmission Cluster Engine). HIV-TRACE implements an approach inspired by traditional epidemiology, by identifying chains of partners whose viral genetic relatedness imply direct or indirect epidemiological connections. Molecular transmission clusters are constructed using codon-aware pairwise alignment to a reference sequence followed by pairwise genetic distance estimation among all sequences. This approach is computationally tractable and is capable of identifying HIV-1 transmission clusters in large surveillance databases comprising tens or hundreds of thousands of sequences in near real time, i.e., on the order of minutes to hours. HIV-TRACE is available at www.hivtrace.org and from github.com/veg/hivtrace, along with the accompanying result visualization module from github.com/veg/hivtrace-viz. Importantly, the approach underlying HIV-TRACE is not limited to the study of HIV-1 and can be applied to study outbreaks and epidemics of other rapidly evolving pathogens.},

Community-level effects, for example those aimed at thwarting future transmission, are potential outcomes of treatment and may be important in stemming the epidemic. However, current clinical trial designs are incapable of detecting a reduction in future transmission due to treatment. We took advantage of the fact that HIV is an evolving pathogen whose transmission network can be reconstructed using genetic sequence information to address this shortcoming. Here, we use an HIV transmission network inferred from recently infected men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Diego, California. We developed and tested a network-based statistic for measuring treatment effects using simulated clinical trials on our inferred transmission network. We explored the statistical power of this network-based statistic against conventional efficacy measures and find that when future transmission is reduced, the potential for increased statistical power can be realized. Furthermore, our simulations demonstrate that the network statistic is able to detect community-level effects (e.g., reduction in onward transmission) of HIV treatment in a clinical trial setting. This study demonstrates the potential utility of a network-based statistical metric when investigating HIV treatment options as a method to reduce onward transmission in a clinical trial setting.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature is found to be a consequence of the two generic mechanisms that networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and new vertices attach preferentially to already well connected sites. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, indicating that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Phylogenetic trees inferred using commonly-used models of sequence evolution are unrooted, but the root position matters both for interpretation and downstream applications. This issue has been long recognized; however, whether the potential for discordance between the species tree and gene trees impacts methods of rooting a phylogenetic tree has not been extensively studied. In this paper, we introduce a new method of rooting a tree based on its branch length distribution; our method, which minimizes the variance of root to tip distances, is inspired by the traditional midpoint rerooting and is justified when deviations from the strict molecular clock are random. Like midpoint rerooting, the method can be implemented in a linear time algorithm. In extensive simulations that consider discordance between gene trees and the species tree, we show that the new method is more accurate than midpoint rerooting, but its relative accuracy compared to using outgroups to root gene trees depends on the size of the dataset and levels of deviations from the strict clock. We show high levels of error for all methods of rooting estimated gene trees due to factors that include effects of gene tree discordance, deviations from the clock, and gene tree estimation error. Our simulations, however, did not reveal significant differences between two equivalent methods for species tree estimation that use rooted and unrooted input, namely, STAR and NJst. Nevertheless, our results point to limitations of existing scalable rooting methods.},

A better understanding of the properties and dynamics of this network is essential for surveillance, prevention, and eventual eradication of HIV. Here, we apply a simple and computationally efficient network-based approach to all publicly available HIV polymerase sequences in the global database, revealing a contemporary picture of the spread of HIV-1 within and between countries. This approach automatically recovered well-characterized transmission clusters and extended other clusters thought to be contained within a single country across international borders. In addition, previously undescribed transmission clusters were discovered. Together, these clusters represent all known modes of HIV transmission. The extent of international linkage revealed by our comprehensive approach demonstrates the need to consider the global diversity of HIV, even when describing local epidemics. Finally, the speed of this method allows for near-real-time surveillance of the pandemic's progression.},

Phylogenetic analysis can be a valid approach for the identification of transmission chains, and very-large data sets can be analysed through parallel computation. Here we propose and validate a new methodology for the partition of large-scale phylogenies and the inference of transmission clusters. This approach, on the basis of a depth-first search algorithm, conjugates the evaluation of node reliability, tree topology and patristic distance analysis. The method has been applied to identify transmission clusters of a phylogeny of 11,541 human immunodeficiency virus-1 subtype B pol gene sequences from a large Italian cohort. Molecular transmission chains were characterized by means of different clinical/demographic factors, such as the interaction between male homosexuals and male heterosexuals. Our method takes an advantage of a flexible notion of transmission cluster and can become a general framework to analyse other epidemics.},

abstract = {Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modelling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first three months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation {\textgreater} 90{\%}), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods' development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:
Partner notification is crucial for sexually transmitted infection (STI) control. We developed Suggestatest.nl (SAT), an internet-based notification system for verified diagnoses of STI/HIV.

METHODS:
SAT uses email, short message service, postal letter or a gay dating site to notify sexual contacts. SAT was piloted at the Public Health STI clinics in two major cities in the Netherlands. We evaluated SAT from March to July 2012 by analysing SAT notifications linked with epidemiological data. Determinants for SAT use were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis.

RESULTS:
Of 988 index clients receiving a SAT code, overall 139 (14{\%}) notified through SAT, sending 505 notifications (median 2), 84{\%} by text messaging and 15{\%} by email; 88{\%} non-anonymously. Of those intending to use SAT, 23{\%} notified with SAT. Intention to use SAT was the only independent determinant of SAT use in heterosexuals and men who have sex with men. Among the 67 SAT users in Rotterdam, 56{\%} (225/402) of their partners at risk were contactable, and 95{\%} (213/225) of those were notified using SAT. 58{\%} of SAT-notified partners accessed the SAT-website and 20{\%} of them subsequently consulted the STI clinics. STI positivity in partners was lower in those notified by SAT (28{\%} (32/116)) than in those with contact cards (45{\%} (68/152); p{\textless}0.001).

CONCLUSIONS:
Although the challenges posed by non-contactable partners are not solved by SAT, it is a valuable novel tool for notification of verified STI diagnoses by index patients and providers. In addition to current standard partner notification practice it suits a small number of clients, especially those reporting more than one partner.},

@article{Moshiri2018,
abstract = {Motivation
The ability to simulate epidemics as a function of model parameters allows insights that are unobtainable from real datasets. Further, reconstructing transmission networks for fast-evolving viruses like HIV may have the potential to greatly enhance epidemic intervention, but transmission network reconstruction methods have been inadequately studied, largely because it is difficult to obtain “truth” sets on which to test them and properly measure their performance.

Results
We introduce FAVITES, a robust framework for simulating realistic datasets for epidemics that are caused by fast-evolving pathogens like HIV. FAVITES creates a generative model to produce contact networks, transmission networks, phylogenetic trees, and sequence datasets, and to add error to the data. FAVITES is designed to be extensible by dividing the generative model into modules, each of which is expressed as a fixed API that can be implemented using various models. We use FAVITES to simulate HIV datasets and study the realism of the simulated datasets. We then use the simulated data to study the impact of the increased treatment efforts on epidemiological outcomes. We also study two transmission network reconstruction methods and their effectiveness in detecting fast-growing clusters.

Availability and implementation
FAVITES is available at https://github.com/niemasd/FAVITES, and a Docker image can be found on DockerHub (https://hub.docker.com/r/niemasd/favites).},

abstract = {Although the use of phylogenetic trees in epidemiological investigations has become commonplace, their epidemiological interpretation has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we use an HIV-1 within-host coalescent model to probabilistically evaluate transmission histories of two epidemiologically linked hosts. Previous critique of phylogenetic reconstruction has claimed that direction of transmission is difficult to infer, and that the existence of unsampled intermediary links or common sources can never be excluded. The phylogenetic relationship between the HIV populations of epidemiologically linked hosts can be classified into six types of trees, based on cladistic relationships and whether the reconstruction is consistent with the true transmission history or not. We show that the direction of transmission and whether unsampled intermediary links or common sources existed make very different predictions about expected phylogenetic relationships: (i) Direction of transmission can often be established when paraphyly exists, (ii) intermediary links can be excluded when multiple lineages were transmitted, and (iii) when the sampled individuals' HIV populations both are monophyletic a common source was likely the origin. Inconsistent results, suggesting the wrong transmission direction, were generally rare. In addition, the expected tree topology also depends on the number of transmitted lineages, the sample size, the time of the sample relative to transmission, and how fast the diversity increases after infection. Typically, 20 or more sequences per subject give robust results. We confirm our theoretical evaluations with analyses of real transmission histories and discuss how our findings should aid in interpreting phylogenetic results.},

@article{Leitner2018,
abstract = {The growth of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sequence databases resulting from drug resistance testing has motivated efforts using phylogenetic methods to assess how HIV spreads 1-4. Such inference is potentially both powerful and useful for tracking the epidemiology of HIV and the allocation of resources to prevention campaigns. We recently used simulation and a small number of illustrative cases to show that certain phylogenetic patterns are associated with different types of epidemiological linkage 5. Our original approach was later generalized for large next-generation sequencing datasets and implemented as a free computational pipeline 6. Previous work has claimed that direction and direct-ness of transmission could not be established from phylogeny because one could not be sure that there were no intervening or missing links involved 7-9. Here, we address this issue by investigating phylogenetic patterns from 272 previously identified HIV transmission chains with 955 transmission pairs representing diverse geography, risk groups, subtypes, and genomic regions. These HIV transmissions had known linkage based on epidemiological information such as partner studies, mother-to-child transmission, pairs identified by contact tracing, and criminal cases. We show that the resulting phylogeny inferred from real HIV genetic sequences indeed reveals distinct patterns associated with direct transmission contra transmissions from a common source. Thus, our results establish how to interpret phylogenetic trees based on HIV sequences when tracking who-infected-whom, when and how genetic information can be used for improved tracking of HIV spread. We also investigate limitations that stem from limited sampling and genetic time-trends in the donor and recipient HIV populations. The phylogenetic analysis of HIV sequences has become a popular method to reveal epidemiological patterns relevant to disease tracking as well as details about transmission. Epidemiological patterns include the fundamental transmission history, which is not possible to directly observe but underlies the observable HIV phylogeny. While it is attractive to assume that these are identical, they may in fact be markedly different 10,11. The main reason for the discrepancy between HIV phylogeny and transmission history is because HIV quickly diversifies in a host. The existence of a highly diverse HIV population also raises the question of how many variants may be transmitted. A highly diverse founding population makes it harder for the immune system to fight HIV, accelerates the time to AIDS 12-15 and increases the probability of transmitting drug-resistant variants and developing future resistance 16. Moreover, the efficacy of immunological-based prevention technologies is reduced 17 and epidemiological relationships are obscured 10,18. Transmission moves a limited number of viral particles from the population of the donor to a recipient 19-22. As HIV within-patient diversity can build up many-years-worth of genetic variation, transmission of even a few particles can represent a highly diverse founding population. Diversity then continues to accumulate 23 , and as the adaptive immune system activates, the diversification rate increases as HIV escapes this evolving pressure 24. Cohort studies of acutely infected persons have used early patterns of diversification to argue that the majority of HIV infections start with a single virus strain, Fig. 1 | Real examples of PP, PM and MM trees. The PP tree comes from a MTCT transmission, the PM tree from a known HET discordant couple transmission, and the MM tree from a HET common source transmission (two recipients from the same known donor source). Each tree shown was randomly selected from 30,000 Bayesian posterior phylogenies per epidemiological pair after burn-in, reconstructed with MrBayes 38 , where the topological class had {\textgreater} 95{\%} posterior support. The detected recipient lineages are labelled with an asterisk. HIV taxa from two epidemiologically linked hosts are separately red or blue. In the PP and PM trees, the population of the donor is in red. Subtype references are in grey. The subtype references correctly root the donor-recipient tree. In the PP and PM trees, the donor HIV population is paraphyletic, encompassing the HIV population of the recipient. In a PP tree, the HIV population of the recipient is polyphyletic; in this example, there are four detected clades. In a PM tree, there is only one detected clade in the recipient; therefore, the population in this recipient is monophyletic. In a MM tree, both the HIV populations in the patients are monophyletic.
